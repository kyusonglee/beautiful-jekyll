title: Payment Suggestion
subtitle: How much do you need to pay to workers?
---
DialCrowd also uses timed sandbox trials to suggest the correct and respectful amount of payment for a HIT. DialCrowd Admin will suggest two numbers for this based on the following equation:
=   (M * T) / 60 
where M is the hourly minimum wage in the requesterâ€™s state and, separately is a wage of $15 per hour. T is average amount of time during internal testing for 10 people. DialCrowd itself does not handle payment - requesters have to use their own accounts with the crowdsourcing website of choice.
